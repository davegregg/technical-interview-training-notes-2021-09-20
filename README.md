## Key Takeaways:
  - **There is only one true way for an interviewer to know for certain whether you would be a good fit for their team**: they would have to hire you. What does this mean? *No one* knows how to lead a perfect interview. In other words, interviews suck. But they are also the only option we have. This is also the central reason why *networking* is so important.
  - Networking provides far more (and more reliable) information than can be obtained in an interview, and is usually associated with a personal referral by an existing team member. Networking also serves as **technical interview practice,** because you will learn software developer jargon (professional terminology) comfortably. (Podcasts and blogs are also great for learning the jargon, as well as the relationships between different technologies or approaches.)
  - A good interviewer's primary goal is **to understand what it would be like to work with you**. A poor interviewer thinks their primary goal is to see if you meet specific requirements. You will meet both. Poor interviewers will often "get it" if you handle the soft-skills aspect of interviewing well.
  - Interviewers will vary wildly in their own interviewing skills. They have bad days, too. So if an interview goes poorly, it may not be your fault. In fact, a "failed" interview is almost always the fault of *everyone* involved (if you showed up on time). **Remember: interviews suck. Don't take it personally.** Even if the interview went well, their budget might change last minute, or their staffing needs might require someone with different experiences from yours. There are simply too many factors involved in a hiring decision to blame yourself. Move forward.
  - **Interviews would not exist if employers were only looking for "yes" or "no" answers**: that's what they have job applications for. Ask clarifying questions. Give clarifying answers.
  - Interviewing well is a learnable set of skills. Interviews are practice for interviews. **"Failed" interviews are just as important as "good" interviews** for building those skills. And other activities can function as interview practice, as well: networking in general, teaching someone else to code, etc.
  - There is no such thing as "my last job interview!!!," until you have both *signed a contract* and *have started Day One.* There is no such thing as a "sure thing" when it comes to job interviews, until you are legally earning money on "company time." So focus on the *learning objective,* not so much on the end result. This will help you manage your expectations, help you relax, and build your confidence. **Interviewing is like _TRYING_ to fall asleep or public speaking: if you obsess about it, you will struggle to achieve it.** You are more likely to freeze when you are afraid of rejection.
  - **Never invest your emotions or plans into a single series of interviews with a company.**

## Understanding the technical interviewer perspective
  - **WHO are technical interviewers?**
    - Probably a current or former software engineer.
    - Maybe a manager or team lead, but maybe not.
  - **How experienced are THEY at technical interviewing?**
    - VERY inexperienced
      - May be just as nervous as you are.
      - Often mistakenly feel that interviews *must* follow "the script." You may need to be the one to open up the discussion.
    - VERY experienced
      - Usually won't follow a strict script.
      - Usually more comfortable, more insightful, and more forgiving.
      - More likely to give you an "unusual" interview - but in a good way.
    - Everyone else in between those extremes.
  - **What are their GOALS?**
    - *An interviewer wants to understand what it would be like to work with you.* They want to know...
    - How you communicate.
      - *Do you listen closely to instructions?*
    - How you problem-solve.
      - *Do you ask questions to understand and explore the problem?*
    - How you fit in a team.
      - *What sorts of teamwork experiences have you had?*
    - Can you manage your own time?
      - *Can you show up to the interview itself on time?*
      - *Do you communicate when ?*
    - Your knowledge.
      - *Can you demonstrate and/or explain basic technical concepts relevant to the role?*
    - That your ego doesn't get in the way of solving problems or communicating.
      - *Do you listen?*
      - *Can you receive instructions?*
      - *Are you trainable?*
      - *Can you receive correction?*
        - If you can't receive correction, then I have no reason to hope that you will GROW over time.

## Interviewing is a SKILL.
  - And sometimes it is a vibe.
    - For example, when you roll out of bed feeling comfortable in your own skin.
  - And sometimes it is pure luck.
  - But overall, it is a set of skills which can be nurtured and developed over time.

## How do you build confidence in a skill?
  - Confidence comes from repetition.
  - Repetition comes from time investment.
    - Your own time management
      - ***SCHEDULE*** time to practice.
    - Your own habits
      - You have either made code your hobby, or you have remained loyal to your own time management long enough that you don't need to *schedule* practice because you will practice anyway.
    - Professional and educational experience
      - A little of both goes a long way.

## EVERY interview is a step in a growth process
  + There is no such thing as "my last job interview," until you have both signed a contract and have started Day One. There is no such thing as a "sure thing" when it comes to job interviews, until you are legally earning money in the company's employ.
  + So focus on the *learning objective,* not so much on the end result. This will help you manage your expectations, help you relax, and build your confidence.
  + Interviewing is like _trying_ to fall asleep: if you obsess about it, you will struggle to achieve it.
  + You are more likely to freeze when you are afraid of rejection.
  + Never invest your emotions or plans in one interview or company.

## What sorts of technical interviews might you expect to encounter?
  - Discussion-based technical interview (one or more interviewers)
  - General problem-solving challenges (no code)
  - Coding challenge, in one of the following forms:
    - Whiteboarding
      - Don't worry about perfect syntax. Treat it like ***pseudocode***.
    - Bug tracking/fixing
    - Pair programming
    - Take-home assessment (asynchronous homework)
    - On-the-spot coding challenge (like whiteboarding, but in an actual code editor of some kind)
    - They may send you a link/invite to a CodeWars kata or similar kind of third-party asynchronous coding challenge.
    - Code review/tracing (you read code and explain as you read)

## How to communicate with a technical interviewer?
  - Be honest. 
  - Be relaxed.
  - Maintain eye contact. (It can be hard, but it is temporary discomfort.)
  - Never be afraid of saying "I don't know."
  - But even better: Ask clarifying questions when you are unsure. (Asking clarifying questions IS a problem-solving technique.)
  - Avoid answering questions with only "yes" or "no." EVERY question. Even questions which *could* be answered with just "yes" or "no" are opportunities to communicate more of how you think to your prospective employer. And that's the point.
  - When natural, allow your answers to be evidence of your interests, especially if they are relevant for the job. Interviews are *not a job application.* ***Interviews would not exist if we were looking only for straight answers.***

## YOUR Goals in a Technical Interview
  - Avoid freezing if you can. Recover quickly if you do.
  - Immediately after, write down notes about the experience, the job, and the company. Identify questions you might have answered better. Don't focus too much on correctness. Focus more on communication.
  - (TODO: This section of the discussion needs expansion...)

## Get better at "talking shop" (using software developer jargon)
  - ANYTHING you can do which requires you
to **explain technical concepts** in a simpler
way is going to be extremely valuable practice
for technical interviews.
    - Teach somebody.
    - Call someone who doesn't mind listening to you talk about something they may not care about.
    - Find a local meetup which is beginner-friendly and just chat with people, or give a short talk (especially, a "Lightning Talk.").
    - All experiences of this kind will help you in interviews, but will also help you when communicating with clients, managers, and all non-technical staff members (sales, customer support, etc.)
  - **Work on your vocabulary.**
    - Listen to developer podcasts.
    - Read articles, documentation (e.g. MDN, React Docs, etc.), and tweets about software development.
    - Research the terms unfamiliar to you and refine your understanding of the terms you are already familiar with.
    - Don't get stuck on the complex phrases you find. Get a general idea about it, if you can, then move on. Return to it at a later time.
