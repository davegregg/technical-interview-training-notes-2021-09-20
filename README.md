# Technical Interviews Training Discussion Notes (2020-09-20)

# Key Takeaways:
  - **There is only one true way for an interviewer to know for certain whether you would be a good fit for their team**: they would have to hire you. What does this mean? *No one* knows how to lead a perfect interview. In other words, interviews suck. But they are also the only option we have. This is also the central reason why *networking* is so important.
  - A good interviewer's primary goal is **to understand what it would be like to work with you**. A poor interviewer thinks their primary goal is to see if you meet specific requirements. You will meet both. Poor interviewers will often "get it" if you handle the soft-skills aspect of interviewing well.
  - Interviewers will vary wildly in their own interviewing skills. And they have bad days, too. If an interview goes poorly, it may not be your fault. In fact, a "failed" interview is almost always the fault of *everyone* involved (if you showed up on time). **Remember: interviews suck. Don't take it personally.**
  - **Never invest your emotions or your plans** into a single series of interviews with a company.
  - **Interviews would not exist if employers were only looking for "yes" or "no" answers**: that's what they have job applications for. Ask clarifying questions. Give clarifying answers.
  - **Interviewing well is a learnable set of skills.** Interviews are practice for interviews. "Failed" interviews are just as important as "good" interviews for building those skills. And other activities can function as interview practice, as well: networking in general, teaching someone else to code, etc.

## Technical Interviewer Perspective
  - **WHO are technical interviewers?**
    - Probably a current or former software engineer.
    - Maybe a manager or team lead, but maybe not.
  - **How experienced are THEY at technical interviewing?**
    - VERY inexperienced
      - May be just as nervous as you are.
      - Often mistakenly feel that interviews *must* follow "the script." You may need to be the one to open up the discussion.
    - VERY experienced
      - Usually won't follow a strict script.
      - Usually more comfortable, more insightful, and more forgiving.
      - More likely to give you an "unusual" interview - but in a good way.
    - Everyone else in between those extremes.
  - **What are their GOALS?**
    - *An interviewer wants to understand what it would be like to work with you.* They want to know...
    - How you communicate.
      - *Do you listen closely to instructions?*
    - How you problem-solve.
      - *Do you ask questions to understand and explore the problem?*
    - How you fit in a team.
      - *What sorts of teamwork experiences have you had?*
    - Can you manage your own time?
      - *Can you show up to the interview itself on time?*
      - *Do you communicate when ?*
    - Your knowledge.
      - *Can you demonstrate and/or explain basic technical concepts relevant to the role?*
    - That your ego doesn't get in the way of solving problems or communicating.
      - *Do you listen?*
      - *Can you receive instructions?*
      - *Are you trainable?*
      - *Can you receive correction?*
        - If you can't receive correction, then I have no reason to hope that you will GROW over time.

## Interviewing is a SKILL.
  - And sometimes it is a vibe.
    - For example, when you roll out of bed feeling comfortable in your own skin.
  - And sometimes it is pure luck.
  - But overall, it is a set of skills which can be nurtured and developed over time.

## How do you build confidence in something?
  - Confidence comes from repetition.
  - Repetition comes from time investment.
    - Your own time management
      - ***SCHEDULE*** time to practice.
    - Your own habits
      - You have either made code your hobby, or you have remained loyal to your own time management long enough that you don't need to *schedule* practice because you will practice anyway.
    - Professional and educational experience
      - A little of both goes a long way.

## We want to treat EVERY interview as a step in a growth process, not the potential end to that process.
  + Focus on the learning objective, not so much on the end result.
  + You are more likely to freeze when you are afraid of rejection.
  + Never put all your hopes, plans, and emotions in one interview or company.

## What sorts of technical interviews might you expect to encounter?
  - Discussion-based technical interview (one or more interviewers)
  - General problem-solving challenges (no code)
  - Coding challenge, in one of the following forms:
    - Whiteboarding
      - Don't worry about perfect syntax. Treat it like ***pseudocode***.
    - Bug tracking/fixing
    - Pair programming
    - Take-home assessment (asynchronous homework)
    - On-the-spot coding challenge (like whiteboarding, but in an actual code editor of some kind)
    - They may send you a link/invite to a CodeWars kata or similar kind of third-party asynchronous coding challenge.
    - Code review/tracing (you read code and explain as you read)

## How to communicate with a technical interviewer?
  - Be honest. 
  - Be relaxed.
  - Maintain eye contact. (It can be hard, but it is temporary discomfort.)
  - Never be afraid of saying "I don't know."
  - But even better: Ask clarifying questions when you are unsure. (Asking clarifying questions IS a problem-solving technique.)
  - Avoid answering questions with only "yes" or "no." EVERY question. Even questions which *could* be answered with just "yes" or "no" are opportunities to communicate more of how you think to your prospective employer. And that's the point.
  - When natural, allow your answers to be evidence of your interests, especially if they are relevant for the job. Interviews are *not a job application.* ***Interviews would not exist if we were looking only for straight answers.***

## YOUR Goals in a Technical Interview
  - Avoid freezing if you can. Recover quickly if you do.
  - Immediately after, write down notes about the experience, the job, and the company. Identify questions you might have answered better. Don't focus too much on correctness. Focus more on communication.

## Get better at "talking shop" (using software developer jargon)
  - ANYTHING you can do which requires you
to **explain technical concepts** in a simpler
way is going to be extremely valuable practice
for technical interviews.
    - Teach somebody.
    - Call someone who doesn't mind listening to you talk about something they may not care about.
    - Find a local meetup which is beginner-friendly and just chat with people, or give a short talk (especially, a "Lightning Talk.").
    - All experiences of this kind will help you in interviews, but will also help you when communicating with clients, managers, and all non-technical staff members (sales, customer support, etc.)
  - **Work on your vocabulary.**
    - Listen to developer podcasts.
    - Read articles, documentation (e.g. MDN, React Docs, etc.), and tweets about software development.
    - Research the terms unfamiliar to you and refine your understanding of the terms you are already familiar with.
    - Don't get stuck on the complex phrases you find. Get a general idea about it, if you can, then move on. Return to it at a later time.
